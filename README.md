# Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

## Overview
The **Stock Price Prediction** project uses machine learning to forecast future stock prices based on historical data, offering users a glimpse into potential future trends. Leveraging **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** models, which are highly effective for time series forecasting, this application provides real-time predictions and intuitive visualizations through an interactive interface. It’s designed for users interested in making data-driven insights into stock market trends.

A live demo of the application can be viewed [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ceq-xLXohI_8InxTxWr8F_8nG1vov8rh/view?usp=sharing).

## Technologies Used

### Core Libraries and Frameworks
- **TensorFlow**: Used to build and train the LSTM-based model, which is optimized for time series forecasting.
- **Yfinance**: Provides access to historical stock data directly from Yahoo Finance, facilitating the acquisition of training and testing data.
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Essential for data preprocessing, feature engineering, and efficient manipulation of data arrays and data frames.
- **Matplotlib**: Used to visualize stock price trends and model predictions, aiding in data interpretation and decision-making.
- **Streamlit**: Creates an interactive web interface where users can input stock symbols, view historical stock data, and see model predictions in real-time.

## Project Structure
Here’s an overview of the project’s file structure:

```
Stock-Price-Prediction-ML/
├── data/                     # Contains any preprocessed or sample datasets
├── model/                    # Stores trained models or serialized model files
├── app.py                    # Main Streamlit app script
├── prediction_model.py       # Core ML code including LSTM model architecture
├── requirements.txt          # List of dependencies and required packages
├── README.md                 # Project documentation
└── utils.py                  # Helper functions for data preprocessing
```

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Stock Price Prediction**: Users can view predictions for upcoming stock prices, based on selected stocks.
- **Time Series Forecasting with LSTM**: The model uses an LSTM network, which is well-suited to capture trends and patterns in sequential data, making it ideal for stock price prediction.
- **Data Visualization**: Historical and predicted stock prices are visualized with trendlines, making it easy to track stock trends over time.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built with Streamlit, the web interface allows users to input a stock symbol and view its predicted price trajectory alongside historical data.

## Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or later
- Git (to clone the repository)

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/Stock-Price-Prediction-ML.git
cd Stock-Price-Prediction-ML
```

### Step 2: Install Required Libraries
Install dependencies specified in `requirements.txt`:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Set Up Environment Variables
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory to store your API credentials (if necessary).
  
### Step 4: Run the Application
Launch the application using Streamlit:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

### Step 5: Access the App
Once the server is running, you can access the app in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`.

## Usage

1. **Input Stock Symbol**: Enter the ticker symbol for the stock you’re interested in (e.g., `AAPL` for Apple).
2. **View Historical Data**: The app retrieves and displays historical stock data from Yahoo Finance.
3. **Predict Future Prices**: The LSTM model processes the historical data and provides a future price prediction, which is plotted alongside the historical data for comparison.

## Screenshots

- The input interface for selecting stocks.
- Visualization of historical and predicted stock prices.
  
## Future Improvements
- **Additional Model Architectures**: Incorporate alternative machine learning models for better comparative analysis and potentially improved accuracy.
- **Enhanced UI/UX**: Improve the interface with additional data insights, such as trading volume, market cap, and other financial indicators.
- **User Authentication**: Add user authentication for a personalized experience where users can save their preferred stock selections.
- **Expanded Prediction Intervals**: Enable users to set custom prediction time intervals.
